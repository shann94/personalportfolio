<div class="col-md-8"> <p>In the Fall of 2015, Katrina Powell was identified as a Distinguished Lecture Scholar for her book "Identity and Power in Narrative Displacements." After interviewing Dr. Powell, my group and I designed this poster to recognize her distinction. Dr. Powell asked for us to use the image in the poster. The image is from her book, and Dr. Powell wanted it to be the cover of the book, but the publisher thought otherwise. She believes that this image captures the overall feel of the book. When the design was completed, Dr. Powell was most than pleased with the design.</p></div></div>

<div class="col-md-8"><p>The Virginia Tech English Department held a contest for student to design and submit a design for their Masters of Arts in English program. This is the cover, back and inside flap of the design. Design was created by myself and Jacquline Bailey at Virginia Tech. At the moment, the Department has not chosen a winner.</p></div></div>

<div class="col-md-8"><p>As part of my public relations internship with Fairfax OB-GYN, I designed multiple brochures for their office to use. This brochure is their Aesthetics Brochure. This is the cover, back and inside flap of the design. Of the designs I made for the practice, this is the one I am most proud of.</p></div></div>
