<p>My name is Shannon O'Dowd. I am a senior, Public Relations major studying at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA. I am very passionate about my education. I believe that anything is achievable with the right communication. I am originally from Frederick, MD where I obtained a Catholic education from Saint John's Catholic Prep.</p>

<p>I am well rounded in the field of public relations, but my passions lie with health communication. I am eager to get involved in projects that involve research, campaign development, implementation, and evaluation.</p>

<p>By the May 2016 I will earn a bachelor's degree in Public Relations with minors in Biological Sciences and Professional and Technical Writing. Additionally, I am prepared to test and receive a certificate in Public Relations. </p>
